## daily-planner

# Description

I needed to create a daily planner that would display timeblocks of the past, present and future for the current day.

# Acceptance Criteria

The current day is displayed when you open the website.
There are timeblocks for a regular 9-5 workday.
The timeblocks are color-coded for past, present and future.
Clicking on a timeblock allows an entry to be input.
Clicking the save button saves the entry into local storage.
The saved entry persists after refreshing the page.

The current day is displayed when you open the webpage.
There are color-coded timeblocks for a 9-5 workday.
